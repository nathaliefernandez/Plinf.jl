Construct a Gen choicemap from observed fluent terms in a PDDL `state`, where

all addresses will be at the top-level. Otherwise, they will be nested under
`addr` as a (hierarchical) address.

        split_idxs = nothing
    )

Construct a vector of Gen choicemaps from observed fluent terms in a sequence of
PDDL `states`. Each term will serve as the choice's base address.

The `init_addr` argument determines the address of the initial observation.
If `include_init` is `true`, the first element of `states` will be converted to
a choicemap for the initial observation (i.e. timestep 0), which is returned 
as the first element of the vector. Otherwise, the first element of `states`
will be treated as the observation for timestep 1. 

The function `addr_fn` will be used to construct a hierarchical address from
the index of each (non-initial) state. By default, observed terms for the `t`th
state will be under the address `:timestep => t => :obs`, where `t = 1`
corresponds to the first element of `states` if `include_init` is `false`, and
to the second element otherwise.

The `batch_size` variable determines how many (non-initial) states are
batched into a single choicemap. By default, each state has its own choicemap.
If `batch_size` is set to `:all`, all states are returned in a single choicemap.

Instead of specifying `batch_size`, a list of `split_idxs` to specify the
indices at which a state trajectory should be split into batches.
